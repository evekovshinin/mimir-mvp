# string value is passed to the `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(seconds=tz)))` constructor as the `tzinfo` argument
# Leave as `None` to skip timestamp printing entirely and assume that the `end_user` is supplying `datetime.now()` in the migration file as the creation date. If using Python's built-in `datetime` module along with the current time, use:
#
#     datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)

# set to 'true' to allow .pyc and .pyo files without

# sourceless = false

# If `true`, the `revision_environment` option is set, and
# the revisions end with a down revision marker in the `down_revision` initialization,
# then `migrate` will not add an alembic_version table into the database.
# This is useful within Docker like environments where alembic reside
# in a temporary directory, and so is not reused across Alembic calls
# and there's no point in having a persistent alembic_version table
# within the database itself.
